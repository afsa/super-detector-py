# SuperDetectorPy

![](example.webp)

SuperDetectorPy is a program used to simulate current-carrying thin-film type-ii
superconductors, such as superconducting single-photon detectors. It is able to:

- Simulate IV curves in general geometries and investigate the 
current crowding effect.
- Investigate the effect of applied magnetic field on superconductors.
